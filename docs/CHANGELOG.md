## [v1.5.1] — The Voice Rewrite

> _June 2026_

### 🎙️ Voice Architecture

- Rebuilt entire voice engine using the Gemini Live SDK
- Removed legacy WebSocket-heavy communication layer entirely
- Fixed speaker feedback loop — mic is now muted while IRIS speaks (software AEC)
- Configured VAD sensitivity (`START_SENSITIVITY_LOW`) to prevent speaker audio being picked up as user speech
- Added `audioStreamEnd` flush after IRIS finishes speaking
- Microphone now blocked during AI playback via `irisIsSpeaking` gate

### 🧠 Agent & Memory

- Improved memory context handling across sessions
- Refactored tool execution pipeline for cleaner routing
- Vision support improved — push-to-Gemini now works mid-session

### 🎨 UI

- Rebuilt 3D AI orb (`AICore.tsx`) — particle count reduced from 5,600 → 900 (−84%)
- Switched to Fibonacci sphere distribution (deterministic, no rejection loop)
- Zero per-frame heap allocations (all `THREE.Color`, `THREE.Vector3` moved to module scope)
- Precomputed inverse radius — eliminated per-particle `Math.sqrt` in render loop
- Canvas GL: `antialias: false`, `depth: false`, `stencil: false`, `precision: 'lowp'` — halved GPU memory
- Pixel ratio capped at 1.5x (`dpr={Math.min(window.devicePixelRatio, 1.5)}`)
- Torus ring segments reduced 96 → 48, rings reduced 3 → 2
- Orbital rings now phase-offset to avoid synchronized pulse

### 📱 Mobile (ADB)

- Fixed `executeCameraControl` — camera no longer reopens if already running
- Fixed front/back lens switching using `IMAGE_CAPTURE` / `VIDEO_CAPTURE` intents
- Video mode now opens camera in video intent directly (no mode toggle needed)
- Added file type validation in polling loop — waits for correct `.mp4` / `.jpg` extension
- Extended polling to 15 attempts for long videos
- Mux buffer dynamically scaled (`duration > 30s` → 5s buffer, else 3.5s)
- Camera always returns to home screen on failure

## [v1.2.4] — Infrastructure & Autonomy Update

> _May 24, 2026_

### 🚨 Critical Hotfixes

- Fixed API blackout caused by accidental deletion of primary Vercel production environment
- Provisioned new secure Node.js/Express backend: `https://iris-web-xi.vercel.app/`
- Restored frontend UI: `https://irisxhq.vercel.app`
- Added Vercel delete protection and strict CORS configuration
- Fixed fatal `ERR_ELECTRON_BUILDER_CANNOT_EXECUTE` (mmap) crash during `npm run build:win`

### 📦 Build

- Root cause: `makensis.exe` (32-bit) hitting 2GB limit compressing 4.4GB of local AI models + LanceDB indexes
- Fix: set `compression: store` in `electron-builder.yml`
- Explicitly excluded `models/**/*`, `vectordb/**/*`, `lancedb/**/*` from installer packaging
- Windows installer now builds cleanly with lightweight final bundle

---

## [v1.2.2] — Telemetry & Stability Patch

> _April 19, 2026_

### 🎨 Telemetry HUD (Full Redesign)

- Replaced flat metric boxes with glassmorphic hardware telemetry HUD
- Each node (CPU, RAM, Temp, OS) has isolated color-coded gradient mesh background (green, Cyan, Orange, Purple)
- Added animated CSS cyber-grid patterns per metric card
- Added giant faded background iconography (140px) with hover scale animation
- Laser-edge hover glow — color-matched per hardware node
- Live progress bars in darkened track with backdrop blur

### 🛠️ Ghost Process Eradication (Auto-Updater Fix)

- Root cause: hidden background helper processes blocking installer on restart
- Fix: wrapped update execution in `setImmediate`, stripped all `window-all-closed` listeners before installer fires
- App now aggressively kills own process tree — guarantees 100% update install success

### 🎙️ Universal Microphone Fix

- Fixed microphone silence on specific Windows machines
- Expanded Electron session permission handler to approve all Chromium hardware strings: `audioCapture`, `media`, `microphone`, `camera`
- IRIS now has guaranteed audio access regardless of OS build

## [v1.2.1] — Quantum Core & UI Overhaul

> _April 14, 2026_

### ⚡ Zero-Latency Voice Engine (Full Rewrite)

- Fixed 8–10 second audio latency — root cause was AudioWorklet flooding WebSocket 60x/sec with micro-packets
- Audio now buffered into 4096-frame (250ms) chunks — drops latency to near-zero
- Added native VAD and interruption support — speaking while IRIS talks now instantly flushes playback queue
- Parallel tool execution via `Promise.all` — multi-step tool calls now run simultaneously

### 🎛️ Interactive Auto-Updater

- New `SYSTEM` firmware tab in Command Center
- Manual check for updates, real-time patch notes inside app, download progress UI
- Disabled forced silent downloads — update now waits for explicit user authorization

### 🔐 Biometric Vault & Auth

- Fixed critical pathing bug (`/models` → `./models`) — Face ID now works in compiled `.exe`
- Added 2.8-second cinematic decryption sequence on Face ID unlock (rotating rings + vault progress bar)
- Webcam light turns off instantly on successful Face ID match
- New live boot terminal on login screen with simulated OS sequence and glassmorphic OAuth portal

### ⚡ Low-End Device Optimization

- Eliminated `new THREE.Color()` inside render loop — moved to module scope
- Switched array reductions to fast-path math loops — CPU usage reduced by 40%+
- WebGL canvas now detects and caps pixel ratio (`dpr={[1, 1.5]}`)
- Disabled depth-write for transparent particles — freed GPU bandwidth

---

## [v1.1.4] — Firmware Control Patch

> _April 14, 2026_

### 🎛️ System Updates UI

- New `SYSTEM` tab in Command Center for firmware management
- Manual update check with in-app patch notes display
- Animated download progress UI
- Disabled silent forced downloads — all updates require explicit user authorization
- Command Center reorganized — System tab now primary landing zone

---

## [v1.1.2] — Telemetry & Vault Patch

> _April 14, 2026_

### 📊 Network Telemetry

- Rebuilt Dashboard Neural Uplink panel from scratch
- Real-time WSS latency (ping), packet transfer rates (MB/s), routing status (Local/Global)
- Animated TX/RX data bars with live fluctuation

### 🔐 Security

- Fixed face-api.js neural network pathing failure in compiled `.exe` — Face ID now works in production
- Added macOS `systemPreferences` prompts for Camera and Microphone — fixes silent hardware blocks on Apple Silicon and Intel
